# Fiasco Platforms

This folder has a subdirectory for each platform which is supported by the
Fiasco team.

A platform is the software which has the program's main entry point and wraps
the engine. It is also responsible for disk and network IO and other
non-deterministic functionality.

The "native" platform works on Mac OS and Windows OS.
