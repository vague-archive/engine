# Tools

This folder is for tools to help building games, editing, and debugging. If
there is a program which helps create a game, but isn't shipped with the game
itself, it's likely a tool.

Each directory herein will contain a README.md with more details, but here's a
brief statement about each:

- [`codegen-rust`] - generate interfaces for Rust code
- [`ipc_tester`] - test platform for tooling IPC
