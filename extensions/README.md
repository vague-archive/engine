# Platform Native Extensions

This directory contains optional extensions to the native Fiasco platform.
Native is used to mean that platform is not running within a browser, for
example (which is in the ../../web directory).

A platform extension is intended to implement optional platform features which
one game may want and another game may not.

To create a new Extension, create a sub-directory herein with a suitable name.
